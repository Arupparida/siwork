Option 3
-> Setup bridge on raspberry pi to push data locally onto the same raspberry pi from which the bash file will take the data (explained in option 2).
-> In this option we will utilize queueing feature of bridge to prevent data loss and further use bash and python files to add some new fields to the data.
-> Only run MQTTpub.sh file keeping the MQTTsub.sh and BrokerInfo.py in the same folder as MQTTpub.sh
